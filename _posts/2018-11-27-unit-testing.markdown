Welcome to Session 4, Unit Testing for Reproducible Science.

### How to Prepare
To prepare for this session, please make sure to do the following before
Tuesday, November 27th:

1. Make sure that you have a version of Python3 (preferably python3.7) installed.
1. Have an existing Jupyter notebook or Python package on hand to write some tests for. It doesn't have to be perfect; one of the things we'll cover during the seminar is how to test less-than-perfect code. If you don't have one that's okay; we can provide you with one if needed.

### What to Bring

Please bring your laptop and charger.

### Materials
The written class material can be found [here](https://github.com/thejunglejane/unit-testing-seminar). This seminar will be very interactive, and we'll be adding to this material during the seminar. Feel free to fork and/or clone this repository to follow along on your laptop.
